<body><h1>Hello World</h1>
Welcome to a Vagrant server running Apache and Tomcat 7.
<p></p>
Apache and Tomcat are running separately.  Apache is not a proxy for Tomcat.
<p></p>
<h2> Ports </h2>
Apache is running on port 80 on the vagrant vm and shows up on port 8080 on the host
server.
<p></p>
Tomcat is running on 8080 on vagrant and shows up on port 9090 on the host
server.

<p/>
The OPEN JDK version of Java is also installed.
<p/>
<h2>The /vagrant directory</h2>

Vagrant VMs are setup to map the starting directory on the host server
to the /vagrant directory in the Vagrant VM.  This makes files on the
host server visible
in the VM. Note that  permissions get complex so operations in the VM on files
visible in /vagrant may require copying the file to a different VM
directory.  Simply reading files seems to work fine.
<p></p>
On the vagrant server the /var/www directory is linked to /vagrant and is the
document root for Apache.  Files you place in the starting 
directory on the host server will be visible
to Apache.
<p/>
The tomcat webapps directory on the Vagrant VM is at /var/lib/tomcat7/webapps.  Copying
war files from /vagrant will install them.  Because of permissions
issues the copy should be done from within the Vagrant VM.
Use 'vagrant ssh' to log into the VM to manipulate the files.
<h2> Student Dashboard</h2>
<p/>
The 
<a href="http://localhost:9090/StudentDashboard" >Student Dashboard</a>
application is available here.
